 * <p>A deployment strategy defines important criteria for rolling out your configuration to
 *          the designated targets. A deployment strategy includes: the overall duration required, a
 *          percentage of targets to receive the deployment during each interval, an algorithm that
 *          defines how percentage grows, and bake time.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { AppConfigClient, CreateDeploymentStrategyCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-appconfig"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { AppConfigClient, CreateDeploymentStrategyCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-appconfig"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new AppConfigClient(config);
 * const command = new CreateDeploymentStrategyCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link CreateDeploymentStrategyCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link CreateDeploymentStrategyCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link AppConfigClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
